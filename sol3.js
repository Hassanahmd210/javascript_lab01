console.log(opr)
// the output for the above code is 6 because "^" works as a bitwise operator
// which performs XOR operation on the binary equivalent of the numbers givenn 
//The binary representation of 2 is 0010.
//The binary representation of 4 is 0100.
// hence the result is 6 i.e is 0110.
